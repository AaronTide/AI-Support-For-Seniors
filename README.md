# SilverBridge AI

AI-powered voice-first benefits navigator for older adults.

SilverBridge helps seniors discover support programs they may qualify for, understand eligibility requirements in plain language, remember application progress, and receive step-by-step guidance through complex public support systems.

---

# Problem

Many older adults miss out on critical support services because:

* Eligibility rules are confusing
* Government websites are difficult to navigate
* Instructions are hard to remember
* Follow-up actions are often forgotten
* Many seniors have limited digital literacy

SilverBridge acts as an AI caseworker that guides users through the process and remembers their application journey.

# Current Features

## 1. AI Chat Assistant

Users can send natural language questions to Gemini through the FastAPI backend.

Example:

> I am 72 years old and live alone.

Gemini responds conversationally.

---

## 2. Memory Storage

Important user information can be stored in SQLite.

Example memories:

* User is 72 years old
* User lives alone
* User receives social security
* User must submit proof of income before Friday

API:

```http
POST /memory
```

---

## 3. Memory Retrieval

Stored memories can be viewed.

API:

```http
GET /memories
```

---

## 4. Semantic Search with ChromaDB

Memories are automatically embedded and stored in ChromaDB.

Users can retrieve relevant memories using natural language queries.

Examples:

Query:

> income documents

Result:

> User must submit proof of income before Friday

API:

```http
GET /search?query=income documents
```

# Next Tasks

## Phase 3 - AI Memory Recall

Goal:

Allow Gemini to automatically use relevant memories when answering.

Example:

User:

> What should I do next?

System:

1. Search ChromaDB
2. Retrieve relevant memories
3. Inject memories into Gemini prompt
4. Generate personalized response

---

## Phase 4 - Benefits Eligibility Engine

Goal:

Help users understand what support programs they may qualify for.

Implementation:

* Create support program database
* Store eligibility criteria
* Collect user information through conversation
* Match user profile to programs
* Explain eligibility reasoning
* Generate next steps

Example:

> You may qualify for Senior Utility Assistance because you are over 65 and live alone. The only missing information is proof of income.

---

## Phase 5 - Action Checklist Generator

Goal:

Generate personalized task lists.

Example:

Application Checklist:

* [ ] Gather proof of income
* [ ] Gather ID
* [ ] Contact support office
* [ ] Submit application

---

## Phase 6 - Voice Interface

Goal:

Allow seniors to interact using speech instead of typing.

Possible Stack:

* Whisper
* Gemini Audio
* Browser Speech API

---

# Hackathon Demo Vision

Scenario:

1. User asks what support programs they may qualify for.
2. AI asks clarifying questions.
3. AI determines likely eligibility.
4. AI creates a checklist.
5. AI remembers previous conversations.
6. User returns later and asks:

   > What do I still need to do?
7. AI retrieves memories and provides guidance.

This demonstrates AI reasoning, memory, and support-system navigation rather than acting as a simple directory of resources.
